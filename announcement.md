# ðŸŽ® DFC Bot Launch Announcement ðŸŽ®

**Attention all DFC Duelers!**

We're excited to announce the official launch of the DFC Discord Bot! This new tool will streamline tournament management, player registrations, and stat tracking for all our events.
As it stands, standard discord app commands are disabled by default for DFC Duelers, so we will be using the "!" syntax for now. @DFC-Data will respond with a DM.

## Available Commands

### ðŸ”¹ `!register dueler_name:<your name>`
Register yourself as an official DFC dueler. This is your first step to participate in events! Will add you to our database if not already found.

Get the link to sign up for the upcoming weekly tournament (Google Form), along with a link to the rules.
*Requires DFC Dueler role*
